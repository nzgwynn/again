\begin{abstract}
Matching in cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) is important, but there is
no best practice. When baseline data is available, we suggest a
technique which can be used to identify the best weighting of pertinent
variables to enable more balance between treatment and control groups.
This technique involves standardizing the variables, computing the
Mahalanobis distance, use matching to find pairs, then randomizing and
rerandomizing. For each randomiziation we compute the difference in the
treatment and control arms for each variable and plot these on a
parallel-coordinates plot. Investigators can compare plots to identify
weighting for advantageous randomization schema.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

To determine the efficacy of a treatment, individually randomized trials
(IRTs) with blinding are the ``strongest study design available''
\citep{gatsonis2017methods}. Unfortunately, cost and study design
amongst other things mean some interventions can not be randomized on an
individual level. For example, education researchers decide to determine
if training elementary school teachers in a reading program will affect
literacy skills in third graders. Randomizing each third grader to
treatment or control would not be suitable, as this equates to randomly
allocating students to a teacher; rural schools tend to be smaller with
only one teacher which further complicates matters. Instead, researchers
may choose to randomize teachers, schools, or counties to determine any
differences between the two arms of the study. Trials where groups are
randomized are called cluster randomized trials (CRTs). Three reasons
for conducting a CRTs are: (i) implementation occurs at the cluster
level, (ii) to avoid contamination, and (iii) to measure intervention
effects among cluster members who do not receive treatment
\citep{balzer2012match, CRTrials2009}. CRTs are ``the gold standard when
allocation of identifiable groups is necessary''
\citep{murray2004design}.

Many authors debate matching in CRTs
\citep{balzer2012match, CRTrials2009, gatsonis2017methods, diehr1995breaking, murray1998design, imai2009essential, PMVsStrat, donner2007merits, klar1997merits, donner2000design, martin1993effect}.
Murray argues that ``the choice of matching or stratification {[}of{]}
factors is critical to the success of the procedure''
\citep{murray1998design}. Some agree that caution must be used when
matching a small number of clusters due to the decrease in power
\citep{donner2000design, klar1997merits, balzer2012match, martin1993effect}.
Breaking matches in the analysis stage addresses this
\citep{diehr1995breaking}, but perhaps only when there are a small
number of large clusters \citep{donner2007merits}. Others argue that
matching is effective in a small number of clusters as it ``increases
the chance of the intervention groups being well-balanced''
\citep{donner2007merits}. Imai et al argue that not matching, in small
or large sample, is ``equivalent to discarding a considerable fraction
of one's data'' \citep{imai2009essential}. However, in one trial
``matching actually led to a loss in statistical efficiency''
\citep[\citet{donner2000design}]{manun1994influence}.

Despite all this debate few authors discuss methodologies to support the
matching process \citep{raab2001balance}. An alternative to matching
suggests balancing criterion based on conditioned means of covariates
\citep{raab2001balance}. ZUBIZARRETA \citep{greevy2004optimal}. Our
article is an extension of methods introduced in Chapter 4 of Methods in
Comparative Effectiveness Research \citep{gatsonis2017methods}. We
suggest a method suitable for \(a\) \(priori\) matching using baseline
data. In section 2 we outline our method, section 3 applies it to the
SWAPOUT dataset, and section 4 is a brief discussion.

\subsection{Methods }\label{methods}

To approach this complex topic of balancing randomization in CRTs we
suggest a new approach. Our approach involves weighting variables of
import, matching units using these weights, and randomizing many times
to obtain a distribution of possibilities when official randomization
occurs. Investigators assess these distributions to determine if
possible randomizations are sufficiently balanced, if not, weighting is
adjusted and the process begins again. The details follow.

The initial step involves prioritizing variables \((1, 2,..., m)\) from
units \((1, 2, ..., n)\) to be randomized. We have

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \overline{V_1} & = & (v_{11}, v_{12},..., v_{1n})\\
 \overline{V_2} & = & (v_{21}, v_{22},..., v_{2n})\\
 \vdots & = & \vdots\\    
 \overline{V_m} & = & (v_{m1}, v_{m2},..., v_{mn}).\\
 \end{eqnarray*}

In addition, we use \(\overline{w} = (w_{1}, w_{2},..., w_{m})\) to
weight and standardize
\((\overline{V_1}, \overline{V_2}, ..., \overline{V_m}).\) We have

\begin{eqnarray*}
v^{*}_{ij} = \frac{(v_{ij} - \frac{\sum _{k=1}^{n}v_{ik}}{n})*w_i}{sd(\overline{V_i})} 
 \end{eqnarray*}

where \(sd(\overline{V_i})\) is the standard deviation of
\(\overline{V_i}.\) We now have

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \overline{V_1^*} & = & (v_{11}^*, v_{12}^*,..., v_{1n}^*)\\
 \overline{V_2^*} & = & (v_{21}^*, v_{22}^*,..., v_{2n}^*)\\
 \vdots & = & \vdots\\    
 \overline{V_m^*} & = & (v_{m1}^*, v_{m2}^*,..., v_{mn}^*).\\
 \end{eqnarray*}

which we use to compute the Mahalanobois Distance matrix, \textbf{D}.
From here we use the \texttt{nmatch} function in the
\texttt{designmatch} \citep{doi} package in \texttt{R} \citep{nmatch}to
find \(\frac{n}{2}\) pairs if \(n\) is even. If \(n\) is odd, the
remainder can be randomized to treatment or control per the principal
investigator. Without loss of generality, we assume \(n\) is even for
the remainder of this paper and note that to include an odd \(n\) either
treatment or control groups will include one more set of priority
variables.

Once the matching is completed and pairs found we return to using the
raw data, as this will be used to assess the weighting scheme. We now
have pairs
\((\overline{V}_{11}, \overline{V}_{12}), (\overline{V}_{21}, \overline{V}_{22}), ..., (\overline{V}_{\frac{n}{2}1}, \overline{V}_{\frac{n}{2}2}).\)
The first match in each pair will be randomized to either treatment or
control using the \texttt{rbinom} function in \texttt{R}. Next, we
subset \(\overline{V}_1, \overline{V}_2, ..., \overline{V}_m\) into
appropriate randomization subgroups:
\(\overline{V}_{1T}, \overline{V}_{1C}, \overline{V}_{2T}, \overline{V}_{2C},..., \overline{V}_{\frac{n}{2}T}, \overline{V}_{\frac{n}{2}C}\)
where \(\overline{V}_{iT} = (v_{i1}^T, v_{i2}^T,..., v_{in}^T),\)
similarly for \(\overline{V}_{iC}.\) Using these we find

\begin{eqnarray*}
 k_j = | \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{n}{2}}v_{ij}^T - \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{n}{2}}v_{ij}^C | 
\end{eqnarray*}

THE ABOVE NEEDS A BETTER ABSOLUTE VALUE SYMBOL. for
\(j = 1, 2, ..., m.\) We randomize \(N\) times and find \(k_{lj}\) the
difference in the two arms for the \(j^{th}\) priority variable for each
of the \(l = 1, 2, ..., N\) re-randomizations. To assist analysis we
draw a parallel coordinates plot where the \(j^{th}\) axis plots
\(k_{lj}\) for \(l = 1, 2, ..., N.\) If the principal investigator finds
the possible differences too large for a priority variable \(j\),
increasing \(w_j\) and re-running the above will update the matching to
attain closer matches for this variable and lessen the differences. The
penality in this process is that closer matches for variable \(j\) are
likely to imply reduced closeness in another variable, so compromises
must be made.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

To demonstrate the usefulness of this technique we present a brief
summary of our randomization process using baseline data from the
SWAPOUT trial (Cluster-randomized Non-inferiority Trial Comparing
Mupirocin vs Iodophor for Nasal Decolonization of ICU Patients to Assess
Impact on Staphylococcus aureus Clinical Cultures and All-cause
Bloodstream Infection During Routine Chlorhexidine Bathing)
\citep{SOTrial}. In this non-inferiority trial, the investigators are
studying whether bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate and swabbing
iodophor nasal swabs are inferior to bathing with the same and mupirocin
nasal swabs. REDUCE trial ADD REF mupirocin nasal swabs and bathing with
chlorhexidine reduced the MRSA Staphylococcus aureus (an antibiotic
resistant infection) in Hospital Corporation of America intensive care
units (ICU). However, physicians are reluctant to use mupirocin, an
antibiotic, so investigators are swapping it with iodophor.

Prior to randomization baseline data was collected for 20 months on the
137 hospitals. With this data, investigators met to prioritize baseline
variables into several categories: primary, secondary, tertiary,
quaternary, and not relevant to randomization. For this trial, the
investigators decided that average monthly volume of patients with
attributable time, average monthly attributable days, Staphylococcus
aureus ICU-attributable cultures per 1,000 days, MRSA ICU-attributable
cultures per 1,000 days, all pathogen ICU-attributable bacteremia
cultures per 1,000 days, regional mupirocin resistance estimate, percent
of admissions with MRSA diagnosis within a year, percent of mupirocin
use admission to day 5, survey Chlorhexidine Glucominate were all of
primary importance. Of secondary importance were median ICU length of
stay, and mean elixhauser total score. Of tertiary importance were the
percentage of ICU medicaid patients, and Polymerase chain reaction
clinical specimen status. Lastly, percent admissions to skilled nursing
facility (SNF), and if the ICU has specialty units for burn, trauma,
etc. A list of abbreviations in the above order can be found in Table 1.
To ease understanding, our initial discussion will involve 3 variables:
Patient days, Staphylococcus auer rate, and MRSA rate.

Prior to randomization, investigators spent time using a web application
built using the \texttt{Shiny} package in \texttt{R}. The purpose of
this is to determine which weights give advantageous balance across
relevant baseline variables.
